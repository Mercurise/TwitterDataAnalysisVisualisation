# TwitterDataAnalysisVisualisation
This is a simple quick demo project to practice ```big data collection``` and ```visualisation```. It's a small practice to retrieve the followers of a target twitter account by a Python-based twitter API tool called [Tweepy](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Then visualise these social connections using a popular dynamic javascript called [d3js](https://d3js.org/).

To simplify the visualisation procedure (avoid local javascript setup), I used a publicly accessible platform called [observable](https://observablehq.com/) as a host for the visualisation results. Furthermore, the observable supports live codes, which you can edit your codes on the website and update the outcome visualisations. 

The simple demo visualisation can be found [here](https://observablehq.com/d/fcd695534e852304) based on [Mike Bostock's demo](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph) and inspiration from [erikaris's post](http://erikaris.com/2018/08/21/using-d3-to-visualize-twitter-followers/). Feel free to fork and modify it with more eyes-catching d3js templates. Next, I'll demonstrate detailed steps on conducting this with a jupyter notebook provided.
